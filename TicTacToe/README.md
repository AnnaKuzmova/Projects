# TicTacToe - browser game

# Description:
The TicTacToe project is my implementation pf the classical tic-tac-toe game in which two players alternately put X's and O's in sections of a figure, formed by two vertical and two horizontal lines crossing each other. 

When the first one makes a row, then a modal which holds information about who has won, comes up. 
I hope in the future to implement more features to the game, allowing more options for the users(players).
