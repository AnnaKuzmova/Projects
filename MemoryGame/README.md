# Description
  The **MemoryGame** project is my implementation of the classical children's memory game, played with set of cards. If the two chosen card have the same picture, then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards upside down. 

  In my version of the game the user can choose from set of 12 cards and monitor his count of **matches** and **turns**.
  If the user guesses all 6 paired matches, then a modal with congratualating headings shows up. Then the user can restart the game.
  In the future I hope to implement timer and limit the count of the **turns**, to create an alternative of losing the game.
